DESCRIPTION:

This is a simple implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game in C++. The game allows two players to play against each other by taking turns to mark a 3x3 grid with 'X' or 'O'. The program keeps track of each player's score across multiple rounds, and it offers a user-friendly interface with colored text output to enhance the gameplay experience.

FEATURES:

Two-Player Mode: Two players can compete by taking turns to mark the grid.

Score Tracking: The program maintains a score tally for both players.

Input Validation: The game checks for valid moves and prompts the player to re-enter if the move is invalid.

Winning Condition Check: The game automatically checks for a winner or a draw after each move.

Instructions: A dedicated instructions section explains the rules of the game.

Colored Interface: The game uses color to distinguish between player moves, making it visually engaging.

HOW TO PLAY:

Make Your Move: Players take turns selecting a grid position to place their 'X' or 'O'.

Win or Draw: The first player to align three of their marks in a row, column, or diagonal wins. If all positions are filled without a winner, the game ends in a draw.
